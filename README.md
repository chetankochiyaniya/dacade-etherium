# MyNFT Contract

This repository contains the code for a Solidity smart contract that allows minting and basic interaction with non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on the Ethereum network.

## Overview

The `MyNFT` contract is an ERC721-compliant NFT contract that provides functionality for minting, burning, and querying NFTs. It allows the owner of the contract to mint new tokens and burn existing tokens.

## Features

- **Minting**: The owner of the contract can mint new NFTs and assign them to specified recipients.
- **Burning**: The owner of the contract can burn (delete) existing NFTs by their token IDs.
- **Total Supply**: Provides a function to get the total number of tokens minted.

## Getting Started

To deploy and interact with the `MyNFT` contract, follow these steps:

1. Install Hardhat and initialize a new project:

```
npm install --save-dev hardhat
npx hardhat
```

2. Install the required dependencies:

```
npm install @openzeppelin/contracts
```

3. Replace the content of `contracts/MyNFT.sol` in your Hardhat project with the provided contract code.

4. Write tests in the `test/` directory to verify the functionality of the contract.

5. Compile the contract:

```
npx hardhat compile
```

6. Test the contract:

```
npx hardhat test
```

7. Deploy the contract to a testnet or local Ethereum network:

```
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```

Make sure to replace the placeholder content in `deploy.js` with the actual deployment logic.

## Dependencies

- **Hardhat**: Development environment for Ethereum smart contracts.
- **OpenZeppelin Contracts**: Library for secure and community-vetted smart contract code.
